# smart-scheduler

This project is a smart scheduling web application designed to help students manage their academic workload. It features a **React** frontend and a **Flask** backend connected to a **MySQL** database, supporting consistent data structures for _assignments_, _quizzes_, _exams_, and _events_. Users can input tasks with course IDs, titles, dates, durations, and weights, which are then automatically organized into study blocks and displayed on a weekly calendar. The current implementation includes foundational scheduling logic and task visualization. The next major milestone is **to implement a dynamic programming algorithm that intelligently allocates study time based on task urgency, estimated effort, and user availability**, enabling optimized and personalized study schedules.
